# Organizational Issues (Coding)
For all our coding exercises as well as the exam (most likely), we will be using notebooks in Google Colab ([colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)).

If you have a functioning google account, you should be able to:

+ Create new notebooks
+ Save notebooks to your Google Drive and open them again
+ Open notebooks from Github repositories
+ Share notebooks with your fellow students

Thus, make sure that you have a Google account!

# Working in groups
When doing exercises in the lecture, you will work in groups of three in break-out rooms on Zoom:

+ The groups are randomly assigned by us
+ Within groups you should share your google account email so that you are able to collaborate
+ We (the lectures) will go from room to room to check your progress and and answer your questions


# Questions

+ If the question is not urgent, please ask during the lecture
+ If urgent, write me an email (j.hansen@uni-koeln.de)

# Today's agenda
The goal of today's session is to give you a short overview of working with python for data analysis. This includes:

+ An overview of basic data structures and commands in python
+ Providing a toolkit for data analysis in python

Note: Today's session is far from exhaustive. More packages, concepts and commands will be introduced later in the course.
